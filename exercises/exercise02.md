# Exercise 02: Version Control with Git
## Creating a dev branch and stagging/committing changes
1. Access your dev environment through GitPod:
    -    Navigate to https://gitpod.io/
    - Select "Continue with GitHub", authorize Gitpod to access your GitHub account, and sign in with your credentials
    - Select your existing workspace from Week 1
       - Select the three verticle dots on the right-hand side of your workspace and select "Open"

2. Currently, you should be working within the main branch of this repo, but this is a protected branch to which we cannot commit direcly. Instead, a dev branch must be created and PR issued to push changes to main. To do this:
    - Use VSCode to create a dev branch by clicking "main" in the bottom left corner, naming your branch in the text box that appears (e.g. `kgl-gc-count-dev`) and selecting "Create new branch".

</p>

    - Click the push icon in the bottom-left corner of your VSCode interface to publish this branch to the remote repository.

</p>

3. From your newly created dev branch, use the VSCode interface to stage the changes you made to `fastq-peak.sh` which add the gc-percentage calculation and reporting.

4. Commit these changes with a comment, e.g. `adding gc-percentage calculation and reporting`.

</p>

5. Use the Sync Changes button that appears to publish this branch to the remote repository.

## Openning a Pull Request
