## Overview 
The Washington State Department of Health, in collaboration with Theiagen Genomics, will be hosting an Advanced Bioinformatics Training Workshop throughout July in their role as WFD lead in the Western Region. This will be a virtual workshop hosted on Mondays and Wednesdays via Zoom from **July 8th - 31st, 2024**.

### Training Objectives
- Develop a comprehensive understanding of software development processes and documentation
- Gain comfort in the use of development tools and version control systems for effective code management
- Learn to apply testing and deployment strategies to ensure code quality and stability
- Explore advanced tools and APIs for data management and workflow automation

### Target Audience
This course is designed for bioinformatics scientists interested in strengthening their skill sets as pipeline developers. We aim to cover a comprehensive range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, ensuring you gain the knowledge and tools needed to excel in your field. 

Participants should have a strong background in bioinformatics, specifically accessing open-source tools through a command-line interface, running bioinformatics pipelines, and proficiency in at least one scripting language (e.g. Python, Pearl, or BASH).  Participants should also have a GitHub account (or an ability to create one) as well as access to a Linux environment within their host institution.

### Course Format 
This will be a 4-week training series occurring on Mondays and Wednesdays from July 8th - 31st, 2024: 
- Mondays (90 min): Lecture material with hands-on exercises
- Wednesdays (60 min): "Office hours" style meeting where participants can ask any questions about the material, and the trainers will address any errors encountered by participants.

All lecture content will be recorded and made available through this GitHub repository to facilitate self-paced and asynchronous learning

## Prerequisites for Hands-On Exercises
In addition to lectures, this course costs of serveral hands-on exercises to reinforce the coursework material. To participate in these exercises, trainees will need the following resources: 
- GitHub Account

  - Once you have registered ensure you are signed into your account on github.com
- GitPod Workspace
  - Navigate to https://gitpod.io/
  - Select "Continue with GitHub", authorize Gitpod to access your GitHub account, and sign in with your credentials
  - Start New Workspace
  - Set the repository to https://github.com/theiagen/Western-WFD-2024/
