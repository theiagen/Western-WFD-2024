## Overview 
The Washington State Department of Health, in collaboration with Theiagen Genomics, will be hosting an Advanced Bioinformatics Training Workshop throughout July in their role as WFD lead in the Western Region. This will be a virtual workshop hosted on Mondays and Wednesdays via Zoom from July 8th - 31st, 2024 (exact times TBD).

Target Audience: This course is designed for bioinformatics scientists interested in strengthening their skill sets as pipeline developers. We aim to cover a comprehensive range of topics, from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, ensuring you gain the knowledge and tools needed to excel in your field. 

Participants should have a strong background in bioinformatics, specifically accessing open-source tools through a command-line interface, running bioinformatics pipelines, and proficiency in at least one scripting language (e.g. Python, Pearl, or BASH).  Participants should also have a GitHub account (or an ability to create one) as well as access to a Linux environment within their host institution.

Course format: This will be a 4-week training series occurring on Mondays and Wednesdays from July 8th - 31st, 2024 (exact times TBD):
